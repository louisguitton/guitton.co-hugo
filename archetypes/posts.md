## Six Questions (30 min)

- What is the most important point?
- Why is that the most important point? (what can you achieve with it)
- Why should people care? (what's the benefit)
- What is the easiest way to understand the most important point?
- How do you want the reader to feel?
- What should the reader do next?

## If it's a "product", fill in Jobs to be Done

> <span style="color:blue">When I</span> [context],
<span style="color:red">but</span> [barrier],
<span style="color:green">help me</span> [goal],
<span style="color:orange">so I</span> [outcome].

e.g. for Discord: When I want to jump into my favorite game, but I donâ€™t know if there are people around to play, help me safely coordinate with a group of like-minded gamers, so I can easily find a way to enjoy my favorite multiplayer game.
