<!--
Checklist before publication
- Review Headlines: Talk benefits, not details. Keep it short
- Review Content skimming: Break it down with bullet points, bolding, spacing
- Review Story: do I have a beginning, a middle, and end? do I tell my emotions?
e.g. storyline of a side project: life before the solution / my approach to solving it / complications I faced / end results / what woul I do differently
-->

## Six Questions (30 min)

- What is the most important point?
- Why is that the most important point? (what can you achieve with it)
- Why should people care? (what's the benefit)
- What is the easiest way to understand the most important point?
- How do you want the reader to feel?
- What should the reader do next?

## If it's a "product", fill in Jobs to be Done

<span style="color:blue">When I</span> [context],
<span style="color:red">but</span> [barrier],
<span style="color:green">help me</span> [goal],
<span style="color:orange">so I</span> [outcome].

e.g. for Discord: When I want to jump into my favorite game, but I donâ€™t know if there are people around to play, help me safely coordinate with a group of like-minded gamers, so I can easily find a way to enjoy my favorite multiplayer game.
