No, I'm not Louis Vuitton ğŸ˜‚.

Instead, I am a Machine Learning Engineer from France, living in **Berlin**. I also [work freelance]({{< ref "/freelance" >}} "Freelance Work") and have entrepreneurial experience.

I have experience with Natural Language Processing (NLP) in python. I am curious and try to keep up with as much research papers as possible, but I'm not a Machine Learning Scientist.

I love Open Source and try to contribute when time allows:
