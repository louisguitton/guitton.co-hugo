## Websites (not looking for projects)

If it's a website or a webapp not related to a data solution, chances are I'm not your best bet.
Therefore, I'm not looking for work in that category but it can happen that friends or
family needs something in that ballpark.

Stack: _Hugo, Netlify, Strapi, React.js, Wordpress_
