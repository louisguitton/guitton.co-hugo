When I was going through Entrepreneur First - trying to turn an idea into a startup - I became aware of my lack of awareness of design.

At that point, I decided to learn more about it and to attend 2 events organised at my co-working space (Factory Berlin GÃ¶rlitzer Park):

- a 2h presentation and Q&A: `UX & UI Design For Entrepreneurs`, on Monday, 16 July 2018
- a 8h bootcamp: `Product Sprint: Design Your Digital Product In A Day`, on Thursday, 19 July 2018

Going into those events, my overall idea of design was more or less:

After going through them, I learned a lot and here are the key learnings.

## Learning 1: UX vs UI

- UX is macro and is synonymous with things difficult to change in the long run.
- UI is micro and synonymous with things that look nice.

## Learning 2: Prototyping Fidelity

There is a time for sketches (now), a time for mid-fidelity mockups (mid term) and a time for high-fidelity designs (later).

## Learning 3: Resources

Just like for programming, there are a lot of open resources out there. But for someone like me with limited knowledge you need them to be organised.

1. Inspiration
1. Assets
    - Layout
    - Colors
    - Typography
1. Branding (feeling and attitude)
1. Animations

More resources and step by step process can be found in the [presentation slidedeck](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1eUwt2AwmTxw-NjVrzFG0G0CSucsUWUKx).
