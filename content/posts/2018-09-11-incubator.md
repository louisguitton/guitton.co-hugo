> My last 5 months and beyond

It feels like a long time since I was last employed. In fact it’s been a little over 5 months.

Some of you might know that back in March, I quit my Data Scientist job in eSports to join [an incubator called EF](https://www.joinef.com/). I wanted to see how tech — specifically deep learning — could be applied to Europe, politics and no, **not Cambridge Analytica style**.

First, some stats. I’ve spent exactly 76 days in the program, working on 2 projects with 2 different co-founders, pitching to 3 business angels, and another 91 days of post-incubator life. That’s **exactly 45.75% of 2018** for you right there.

## The outcome

Looking back and seeing that almost half a year has passed sparks thought: was it worth it? did I learn anything? is the value I got out of it higher that my opportunity cost?

**Yes, Yes and Yes**.

Obviously those are difficult questions that I still wrestle with and time will tell. It is not a self-fulfilling prophecy, the reason for those answers lies somewhere else: in one of the projects that came out from that time.

## Introducing the brain child

The 3 months that followed the incubator were a mixture of reflecting on experiences, reading, design boot camps, freelance projects (_accent on the free_), well-deserved holidays. But the **one project that took most of my time** is the direct brain child from the company I wanted to build.

In my incubator time, I stumbled upon the following technical question: **could an algorithm predict a person’s personality using a video of them** ? Could that be used to level the playing field of hiring interviews, giving equal chances to all?

Like with any other idea, I found out that some really bright people were already working on it. I reached out, and that’s how our present research collaboration was born.

With your help, we’re collecting a unique dataset that will **push the boundaries of Artificial Intelligence**. Algorithms are everywhere nowadays, but none of them understand humans beyond their appearance.

I want to say a **massive thanks** to the people I shared this time with — especially my co-founders and fellow EF cohort members & staff— and to the ones who supported me or answered my calls — girlfriend, friends, …
