I still haven't taken the time to setup [dotfiles](https://www.quora.com/What-are-dotfiles).

But I use a script that gets me 80% of the way there and that I'm pretty happy with.

Credits go to Gitlab's Data team: their open source [onboarding script](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/blob/master/admin/onboarding_script.sh) heavily influenced my script in its present form.

Here is also a blog post on [Getting started with dotfiles](https://medium.com/@webprolific/getting-started-with-dotfiles-43c3602fd789#.u0sci0q71), and a list of [popular dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/) to build your own.
