## Maslow's hierarchy of needs

The other day I read that twitter thread from Paul Graham on learnings:\
{{< tweet 1215673204125073408 >}}

One of the comment was pretty enlightening.

We all have heard of [Maslow's Pyramid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs). It's a simple and effective way to understand human psychology.

As a Software engineer, you then forget about it because human psychology is not exactly core to the job. Or is it ?

## ... applied to retaining talent in tech startups

Where it becomes really interesting is when you apply it to yourself *vis-a-vis* your job. What's your motivation? What can explain your ups and downs there?

We've all seen seemingly-happy colleagues quit. And this refresher gave me a framework to understand why they quit.

Is it for money ðŸ’°- or physiological needs ? (witnessed that a couple times : usually a swing of 10kâ‚¬ per year gross is enough)

Is it for lack of safety ðŸ˜± ? (saw some of that in my time in the incubator)

Is it for lack of belonging or esteem ðŸ’– - or psychological needs ?

Is it for lack of self fulfillment ?
