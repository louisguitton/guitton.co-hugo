I keep coming back to this great piece by John "OpenAi" Schulman : [An Opinionated Guide to ML Research](http://joschu.net/blog/opinionated-guide-ml-research.html).

Here I want to quickly checklist his advice and whether I follow it or not:

1. Choosing problems
    - Honing your taste
        - [ ] Optimise your environment to get input from other researchers
        - [x] Reflect on what research is useful and will pass the test of time
    - Idea-driven vs Goal-driven research
        - [x] Formulate a (per-project) goal that drives you
2. Making continual progress
    - Notebooks
        - [x] Keep a daily notebook
        - [x] Review said notebook every fortnight and every couple of months
    - Switch problems in a controlled way
        - [ ] Allow 1 day per week on something totally different from your main project (~ epsilon greedy for Multi-arm Bandits ; ~ 20% time project)
3. Personal Development
    - build your knowledge of ML
        - [x] Read textbooks and papers
        - [x] Reimplement algorithms from these sources

I do [read textbooks](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/58757583?shelf=textbooks) and
[reimplement algos from textbooks and papers](https://github.com/louisguitton/papers-implemented).
I also hold manuscript and digital research journals ever since my internship advisor at Bosch
in Singapore taught me so in 2014.

2 areas I want to improve are: going back to practising 20% time project (although I do that on weekends basically)
and get more input from other researchers.
