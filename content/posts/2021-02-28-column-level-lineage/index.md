## Six Questions (30 min)

- What is the most important point?

You can use python's `collections.deque` to get
column-level lineage on your SQL codebase.

- Why is that the most important point? (what can you achieve with it)

Column-level lineage can help you connect the
dots between SQL models, e.g. in a dbt codebase.

- Why should people care? (what's the benefit)

For example, you can learn which column-level
tests are redundant and save time while running
`dbt test`.
You can learn which columns are most (and least)
central to your models.

- What is the easiest way to understand the most important point?

Paste your SQL in my webapp, pick a column
and look at the lineage graph.

- How do you want the reader to feel?

More metadata about your SQL codebase is
accessible.

- What should the reader do next?

Try the parser on their own SQL.

e.g. for Discord: When I want to jump into my favorite game, but I donâ€™t know if there are people around to play, help me safely coordinate with a group of like-minded gamers, so I can easily find a way to enjoy my favorite multiplayer game.
