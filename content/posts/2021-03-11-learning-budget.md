Checklist before publication
- Review Headlines: Talk benefits, not details. Keep it short
- Review Content skimming: Break it down with bullet points, bolding, spacing

e.g. storyline of a side project: life before the solution / my approach to solving it / complications I faced / end results / what woul I do differently

## Six Questions (30 min)

- What is the most important point?



- Why is that the most important point? (what can you achieve with it)
- Why should people care? (what's the benefit)
- What is the easiest way to understand the most important point?
- How do you want the reader to feel?
- What should the reader do next?


I see:

books
MOOCs (or recorded trainings)
professional trainings (in-person)
conferences
certifications
a lot of the resources are free (e.g. AWS learn)
so don't pay for courses, instead pay for credits

you need different mediums at different stages of your career and for different stages of your knowledge of a certain tool

if you're getting started with airflow, don't go for https://www.astronomer.io/certification/

the key is to have a routine of learning and a self-budget : were you taking online classes before? were you buying books before ?
It's not because you have money that you should spend it: if you're not used to buying and reading textbooks, you're going to waste time and money.

But it does help to feel "liberated" (although no one was stopping you from investing your own money in yourself)

## If it's a "product", fill in Jobs to be Done

<span style="color:blue">When I</span> [context],
<span style="color:red">but</span> [barrier],
<span style="color:green">help me</span> [goal],
<span style="color:orange">so I</span> [outcome].

e.g. for Discord: When I want to jump into my favorite game, but I donâ€™t know if there are people around to play, help me safely coordinate with a group of like-minded gamers, so I can easily find a way to enjoy my favorite multiplayer game.
