[LittleBits](https://littlebits.com/) are LEGO-like electronic components designed to allow students of all ages to create with technology.

During my time at EDF Energy, my colleagues and I used them extensively to develop electronics hackathons called [#PrettyCurious]({{< ref "/posts/pretty-curious" >}}).

One of the challenges for me was to take those simple components and come up with mini-projects with varying difficulties to create a curriculum that would teach the teenagers attending the hackathons about electronics, coding and physics.

Example of simple activities:

- create a bicycle honk
- control a servomotor

Example of advanced activities:

- transmit music wirelessly like a satellite
- build a wave generator and turn music into water ripples

Overall, the activities were organised in a sensible progression and the narrative would be about the different kinds of energy and the different kinds of wavelength (visible light, infrared, radio, wifi & internet). Looking back, that "curriculum" still seems pretty good.

But on some occasions, I would go off the beaten track and come up with the weirdest projects that - thank God - never made it into the curriculum. Here is a trombone that I made using LittleBits and Arduino. God save the Queen from hearing my interpretation of the english anthem ...

And here is the code that made this piece of art a reality:
