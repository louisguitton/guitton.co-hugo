I left Paris and France in mid 2016 after graduation to come live in Berlin. I have never lived in Lyon, and to be honest I don't know the city really well. But last weekend, I attended a wedding there and I was really surprised by Lyon's love for electric scooters.

Before we carry on, I must admit my confusion as a Frenchman around the usage of the word scooter. For Google — and other American English native speakers I'm sure — [scooter means two things at once](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/scooter), while in french we have two different words for them. There is on the one hand the “_light two-wheeled motor vehicle smaller than a motocycle_” (**scooter** in french) and on the other hand the “_child’s toy consisting of a footboard and a long steering handle_” (**trottinette** in french). In the rest of this article, I will actually discuss Lyon’s love for electric trottinettes.

Mobility is a really interesting space in 2019. In the last few years, I've seen bike sharing (_Velib_ in Paris) and car sharing (_Autolib_ in Paris) evolve into services where you can park anywhere (_Mobike_ and _Drive Now_ in Berlin respectively). Last year in Berlin electric scooters (as in the french scooter) popped up too (_Coup_ in Berlin). The job market followed the trend and suddenly I had friends working for ride-sharing platforms (*Free2Move *in Berlin). But it's in Lyon that I properly discovered electric trottinettes.

Yes, people use them a lot. Yes, people drive them with no concern for pedestrians' security, using sidewalks or streets at their convenience. I had heard of all that from other cities. But the really mind blowing thing was that in a matter of 30 minutes, I could count not less than seven different e-trottinette brands, and I probably missed one or two.

_The physical products look (almost) identical_

Indeed, they don’t look like each other at all. Some of these brands make bold statements like “_reimagining smart mobility_” but to me it seems rather that we’re **reinventing the wheel**. I’ll acknowledge here that I have not downloaded any of the 7 apps, and thus I am commenting only the physical part of those products, ignoring the fact that those brands may differentiate themselves via the app UX, or the scooter’s autonomy…

Apart from the products looking almost identical, I was also surprised by the branding overdose I had while walking around in Lyon. Flashy colours, catchy (english) names (“_Bird_” and “_Wind_” really ?!). Later, when I came home and looked for the brands’ websites, I was not disappointed. The domain names are “trendy”: _tier.app_, _bird.co_ & *wind.co *and of course _li.me_ — kudos for fitting a pun into your domain name. To be fair, three brands had .com websites and one even looked “normal” (_voiscooters.com_) but two of them had to add a verb : _ridedott.com_ and _goflash.com …_

Beyond the domain names, I was also not disappointed by the landing pages themselves, and of course their traditional stock images.

_Startupy branding overdose_

Enough with the sarcasm. I actually had quite some fun walking in Lyon and counting the e-scooter brands. And comparing their websites was a great exercise. Indeed, what would **you** do if you had to release one more of these brands?

As a parting thought, I can’t help but think about these pictures from bike-sharing cemeteries in China. The (probably upcoming) concentration of the e-trotinette market could have the hidden side-effect of creating similar e-trotinette cemeteries.

_No, those are not flowers, but bicycles in China_

As of writing, e-scooters are forbidden in Berlin. But [law is in the making](https://www.berlin.de/special/auto-und-motor/nachrichten/5560401-2301467-e-scooter-elektro-tretroller-verleih.html) to allow them. It will be interesting to see **if the e-scooter Cupid shots Berlin like he shot Lyon**.
